# ===========================================
# File: commented_script.sh
# Author: Ivang Silas Onda
# Purpose: Demonstrate the use of comments
#          and basic Bash scripting tasks.
# Date: April 11, 2025
# ===========================================

# Greet the user based on the current time of day
HOUR=$(date +"%H")  # Get current hour in 24-hour format

if [ $HOUR -lt 12 ]; then
  echo "🌅 Good morning!"
elif [ $HOUR -lt 18 ]; then
  echo "🌞 Good afternoon!"
else
  echo "🌙 Good evening!"
fi

# Show the current system date and time
echo "🕒 Current date and time: $(date)"

# List files in the user's home directory (including hidden files)
echo "📁 Listing files in your home directory:"
ls -la ~  # -l for long format, -a to include hidden files

# Display disk usage in human-readable format
echo "💾 Disk usage:"
df -h  # -h makes sizes human-readable (e.g. GB, MB)

# Count the number of running processes on the system
echo "🔧 Number of running processes:"
ps -e | wc -l  # `ps -e` lists all processes; `wc -l` counts the lines
