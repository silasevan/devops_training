Shell Scripting Project
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Bash shell scripting to automate essential system tasks. It covers creating directories and users, performing file verification, executing scripts, and explaining key shell scripting concepts like shebang (#!) and variables.

The project is structured to reflect a clear understanding of how scripts can streamline system administration tasks on a Unix-based operating system.

🛠️ Features Implemented
✅ 1. Directory and User Management
Script to create multiple directories with specific permissions.

Script to add users and assign them to specific groups.

✅ 2. File Verification and Handling
Check if files/directories exist before performing operations.

Use of conditional statements (if, else) to handle logic safely.

✅ 3. Script Execution
All scripts are executable (chmod +x script_name.sh) and contain proper shebangs (#!/bin/bash).

Clear, consistent naming convention and modular scripting practices.
