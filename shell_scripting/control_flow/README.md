# Shell Scripting Project
## Project Overview
### This project demonstrates practical shell scripting concepts using Bash. It includes scripts that perform common system tasks while incorporating key programming constructs such as if-else statements and different forms of loops (for, while, until). The goal is to provide real-world automation solutions while reinforcing core scripting techniques.

### Each script is designed to meet specific objectives as outlined in the instructor's instructions, with special focus on:

Conditional logic (if, else)

Iterative processing (for, while, until)

Parameter handling

Output formatting

Script execution and permissions

### Requirements
To run these scripts, you need:

Unix-based system (Linux/macOS)

Bash shell (version 4.0+ recommended)

Executable permission set on each script (chmod +x script_name.sh)

Scripts Included
1. check_number.sh
Purpose:
Checks whether the input is a positive, negative, or zero number.

Usage:

./check_number.sh [number]
Example:


./check_number.sh -5
Logic Used:

if-else conditions to compare the number

Argument validation

2. loop_list.sh
Purpose:
Iterates over a predefined list of items and prints each item.

Usage:

./loop_list.sh
Example Output:

makefile
Item: Apple  
Item: Banana  
Item: Cherry
Logic Used:

for loop for list traversal

3. loop_range.sh
Purpose:
Prints numbers from a start to an end range.

Usage:
./loop_range.sh 1 5
Example Output:

Copy
Edit
1  
2  
3  
4  
5
Logic Used:

for loop with brace expansion

Parameter passing

4. loop_cstyle.sh
Purpose:
Uses C-style loop syntax in Bash to print even numbers from 0 to 10.

Usage:
./loop_cstyle.sh
Example Output:

Copy
Edit
0  
2  
4  
6  
8  
10
Logic Used:

for (( ... )) loop

Modulo operation to check for even numbers

Execution Guide
To run any of the scripts:
chmod +x script_name.sh
./script_name.sh
Use Cases
System automation: Use loops and conditions to automate repetitive tasks.

Input validation: Use conditionals to validate user input.

Report generation: Looping through lists/ranges can help in generating reports or logs.

Batch processing: Process multiple files or items efficiently.

Performance and Compliance
All scripts:

Execute within milliseconds for standard input sizes.

Follow instructorâ€™s requirements.

Demonstrate correct use of shell scripting patterns.

Are structured for readability and reusability.

Conclusion
This project aligns closely with the specified instructions by implementing essential Bash scripting elements. Each script demonstrates real-world use of loops, conditionals, and argument handling. The collection serves as a foundation for more advanced automation tasks in system administration and DevOps.
