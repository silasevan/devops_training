# ðŸª£ AWS S3 Bucket Project - `siltechdevbucket`

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This mini-project demonstrates how I created and managed an Amazon S3 bucket named `siltechdevbucket` using the AWS Management Console. The objective was to explore essential features of Amazon S3 such as versioning, bucket policies, lifecycle rules, and object uploads.

## ðŸ”§ Steps Taken

### 1. **Created the S3 Bucket**
- Opened the **AWS S3 Console**
- Clicked on **Create bucket**
- Entered the bucket name: `siltechdevbucket`
- Selected preferred AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
- Kept default settings (Block all public access enabled)
- Clicked **Create bucket**

### 4. **Created Bucket Policy**
- Navigated to the **Permissions** tab of the bucket
- Scrolled to **Bucket Policy**
- Clicked **Edit** and added the following policy to allow public read access to `hello.txt`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::siltechdevbucket/hello.txt"
    }
  ]
}

---

----
### 5. Created Lifecycle Policy
Clicked on the Management tab in the bucket

Clicked Create lifecycle rule

Named the rule (e.g., GlacierTransitionRule)

Applied rule to all objects

Added a transition action for non-current versions

Set the rule to transition non-current versions to Glacier after 30 days
